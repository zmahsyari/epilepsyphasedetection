This project is created to develop a classification model for detecting phases in epilepsy. The data utilized is sourced from PhysioNet, consisting of observations from the ECG signals of 7 patients without heart disease. The data, initially in the form of EDF files, is extracted and transformed into TXT files. Subsequently, data preprocessing is conducted to extract 13 time domain features. The classification model employs SVM-GA with RBF, polynomial, and linear kernels to detect epilepsy phases (pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal, and normal). The evaluation metric used for the model is the F1-score.
This project has been presented at the International Conference on Mathematics, Statistics, and Their Applications (ICMSA) 2023 in Indonesia and has served as a thesis for the completion of the Master of Statistics program at the Department of Statistics, Faculty of Science and Data Analytics, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Indonesia.
