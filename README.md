This project is created to develop a classification model for detecting phases in epilepsy. The data utilized is sourced from PhysioNet, consisting of observations from the ECG signals of 7 patients without heart disease. The data, initially in the form of EDF files, is extracted and transformed into TXT files. Subsequently, data preprocessing is conducted to extract 13 time domain features. The classification model employs SVM-GA with RBF, polynomial, and linear kernels to detect epilepsy phases (pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal, normal). The evaluation metric used for the model is the F1-score.
